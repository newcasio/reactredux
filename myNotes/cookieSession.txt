In the index.js.

When the cookie-session middleware extracts the cookie data from the request, it assigns it to the req.session object (which is an object with the key of user).

Passport is actually looking at req.session to pull out the relevant data to deserialize back to the mongo id.


cookie-session alternative is express-session.  Difference between the two is how the data is stored inside the cookie.
* cookie-session - the cookie IS the session.  It contains all the data related to the current session.  It contains the actual user Id.
* express-session - express saves an reference/Id to a session inside the cookie.  The id is then used to look up the session data which is kept in a separate collection.
